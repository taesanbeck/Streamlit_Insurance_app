## Problem Statement

US healthcare lacks a preventative approach and costs are rising.

Background: 
1. Currently Americans spend \\$2,437 (See Chart Below)  on average per capita on Primary, Preventative, and Prescription(PPP) care and GoForward.com provides PPP care for only \\$1788 annually per capita. 
2. Currently GoForwards \\$1,788 is an additional subscription based fee on top of regular insurance fees.
3. Goforward presents a solution that does not tailor to individual circumstances so we wanted to propose a pricing methodology that would decrease individual PPP expenses, and increase revenue for companies like GoForward through government tax breaks and category based pricing.
4. Our proposed pricing methodology improves PPP accessibility for people by decreasing rates for younger, lower BMI, and non-smokers and many would pay less than forwards 149/month model

st.markdown('''
## Bottom Line Up-Front
After conducting rigorous data analysis, our team looks to propose a business model that builds on that of a private company, GoForward, which provides preventative healthcare services, with enhanced pricing that tailors to individual nuances
and ensures all parties involved stand to benefit - private businesses, government, and, most importantly, our people. Our solution primarily aims to further disintermediate preventative healthcare services by removing insurance companies from the equation.

The GoForward model is predicated on the buildout of establishments that have all the resources necessary to provide preventative, prescription, and primary care healthcare services. With a monthly subscription model, patients may access those facilities, and all services provided, at any time and at no additional cost.
Currently, GoForward uses a universal pricing system at $149/month. However, we believe this does not accurately capture distinctions across age and overall health levels. We propose a pricing model that is enhanced such that those nuances are accommodated.

## Business Impact Analysis

From a business standpoint, a forward model with our proposed pricing model definitely results in a lower top-line. We identified this during our analysis but it was generally to the tune of 5%.

To address potentially decreased incentive, we additionally propose that the government provided a tax cut depending on how efficient a company is at managing its expenses. 
Along those lines, we think the tax rate cut should be 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100 percent if the company in question achieved 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% Operating Margin, respectively.

The chart below showcases that, while companies would see a general decline in top-line, such tax rate cuts would result in a substantial increase to bottom-line - more than compensating for the decline in revenues.
